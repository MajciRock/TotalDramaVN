# TotalDramaVN

This is a Total Drama visual novel game. </br>
You can make decisions that will result in a different game outcome.</br>
The main decisions will influence the game outcome.</br>
Since Total Drama is a "survivor reality show", the contestants will be eliminated, and the decisions the player makes will influence the positioning and relationships between other campers. </br></br>

For new creators and editors: </br>
- the audio and images folders aren't currently visible on the website version because they're both empty </br>
- in the script file you can edit what's happening in the game regarding what's written and the visuals </br>
- any other rpy files use cautiously since this can do drastic changes to the game, it's not recommended for beginners of ren'py or programming in general.</br></br>

Thank you for reading this file and thanks for helping out with this project!
